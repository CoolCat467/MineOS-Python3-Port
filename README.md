## MineOS Python3 Port

This is my attempt at porting MineOS to Python3.
Mostly to learn how MineOS functions, but also as a challange to self.

Current Status:
Parts of the computer component is implemented, but not much.
Component proxy is almost completly implemented.
Component module is almost completly implemented, but some functions may be broken.
Color API is completely implemented.
Bit32 is completely implementented, but may have typographical issues.
Screen is not implemented.
Event API is mostly implemented, may be fully.
Paths API is completely implemented.
Sides API is completely implemented.
Filesystem API is implemented, but loadfile is probably broken and numerouse issues have been observed with the handler class, some coming from component.Proxy.
Filesystem API write is known to function properly, reading may be broken.
Image API is partially implemented, but I am having diffuculties getting encoding method six to load files, and saveing images is being weird.


Anything not listed above is not implemented.
